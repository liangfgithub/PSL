Practical Statistical Learning (PSL)
====================================

(Often humorously dubbed "Pumpkin Spice Latte" by our online students.)

These materials have been curated from a course in statistical learning, developed by Professors **John Marden** (jimarden AT illinois DOT edu) and **Feng Liang** (liangf AT illinois DOT edu) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The course predominantly draws upon the seminal text `The Elements of Statistical Learning <https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/>`_ by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.
